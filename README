OSCam-emu: Open Source Conditional Access Module Emulator
=========================================================


OSCam-emu is an Oscam addon module to include emulator support and other functionality that collides with the goal of the original oscam developers.

This patch creates functional emulator support on a client base so keys can't be reshared over the net, if you want a "shareable" EMU use OSEmu instead and add it as a reader to your plain oscam server.
OSEmu can be found at https://github.com/oscam-emu/OSEmu


Supported systems
=================

Currently only the following crypto systems are available:
 - Cryptoworks
 - NDS
 - Viaaccess-2.3
All of these are basicly working but far from complete so anyone filling in blanks is welcome...


TODO
====

Work has to be done on the following items:
 - Add other encryption systems
 - Add keyfile support
 - More keys


Version history
===============

OSCam-emu history is accessible through GitHub commits at:
   https://github.com/oscam-emu/oscam-emu


Building OSCam-emu from source
==========================

 - Get the lastest oscam sources from SVN:
    svn checkout http://www.streamboard.tv/svn/oscam/trunk oscam-svn

 - save the oscam-emu.patch file

 - Go to oscam-svn directory.

 - Patch the source with the EMU patch:
    patch -p1 < ../oscam-emu.patch

 - Run `./config.sh -g` to choose the features you want. (make sure to include at least all readers, constcw and emu support besides the wanted protocols)

 - Run `make` to compile OSCam.

Configuring the EMU part is easy, there is none, currently all keys are inside the sourceâ€¦
