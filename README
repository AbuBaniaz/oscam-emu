OSCam-Emu: Open Source Conditional Access Module Emulator
=========================================================

OSCam-Emu is an OSCam addon module to include emulator support and other functionality that collides with the goal of the original OSCam developers.

This patch creates a virtual card reader which is configured automatically.
You may save the default reader configuration with the webif and then modify it to your own liking.

Key file ("SoftCam.Key"):
OSCam-Emu does not require, but will make use of "SoftCam.Key" if available.
"SoftCam.Key" is searched in the OSCam config folder (where oscam.conf is located) and also in "/var/keys".

You may use OSEmu instead and add it as a reader to your plain oscam server.
OSEmu can be found at https://github.com/oscam-emu/OSEmu
