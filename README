Building OScam-emu for different CPUs (cross-compilation)
=====================================================

non x86 platform can give issues so no official support for them right now, your on your own…


Dependencies
============

OSCam by default do not depend on external libraries except when compilation
with SSL is requested. In that case openssl (libcrypto) library must be
installed.

OSCam supports building with the following external dependencies:
  - libcrypto (libssl) - 'make USE_LIBCRYPTO=1'
  - libusb             - 'make USE_LIBUSB=1'
  - PCSC               - 'make USE_PCSC=1'

For more information and examples on using the build system, run `make help`.
