OSCam-emu: Open Source Conditional Access Module Emulator
=========================================================


OSCam-emu is an Oscam addon module to include emulator support and other functionality that collides with the goal of the original oscam developers.

This patch creates functional emulator support on a client base, so keys cannot be reshared over the net.
If you want a "shareable" EMU you can add a dummy reader like this:

[reader]
label                         = Emulator
protocol                      = camd35
device                        = 127.0.0.1
caid                          = 0D00,0D02,0D03,0D05,090F,0500,1801,0604
ident                         = 0D00:000000,000004,000010,000014,000020,0000C0,0000C4,0000CC;0D02:000000,00008C,0000A0,0000A4,0000A8;0D03:000000,000004,000008,000024,000028;0D05:000000,000004,000010;090F:000000;0500:030B00,023800,021110,007400,007800;1801:000000;0604:000000
group                         = 1

Or use OSEmu instead and add it as a reader to your plain oscam server.
OSEmu can be found at https://github.com/oscam-emu/OSEmu

Key file ("SoftCam.Key"):
OSEmu does not require, but will make us of "SoftCam.Key" if available.
"SoftCam.Key" is searched in the oscam config folder (where oscam.conf is located).



Supported systems
=================

Currently only the following crypto systems are available:
 - Cryptoworks
 - NDS (proof off concept)
 - Viaccess 1/2/3
 - Nagra 2
 - Irdeto 2
 
All of these are basically working, but far from complete so anyone filling in blanks is welcome...


TODO
====

Work has to be done on the following items:
 - Add other encryption systems


Version history
===============

OSCam-emu history is accessible through GitHub commits at:
   https://github.com/oscam-emu/oscam-emu


Building OSCam-emu from source
==========================

 - Get the lastest oscam sources from SVN:
    svn checkout http://www.streamboard.tv/svn/oscam/trunk oscam-svn

 - Save the oscam-emu.patch file

 - Go to oscam-svn directory.

 - Patch the source with the EMU patch:
    patch -p0 < ../oscam-emu.patch
    
 - OR: Instead of 'patch', you may also use 'svn patch':
    svn patch ../oscam-emu.patch
    
 - Put a SoftCam.Key file into the oscam-svn directory (for example from skystar.org)

 - Run `./config.sh -g` to choose the features you want. (make sure to include at least all readers, constcw and emu support besides the wanted protocols)

 - Run `make` to compile OSCam.
